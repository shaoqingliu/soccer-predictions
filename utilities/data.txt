The 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the fifth edition of the Gold Cup, the soccer championship of North America, Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), and the 15th overall CONCACAF tournIt was held in the United States, in Los Angeles, Miami, and San Diego. The format of the tournament changed from 1998; it was expanded to twelve teams, split into four groups of three. The top two teams in each group would advance to the quarterfinals. Peru and Colombia were invited from CONMEBOL, and the Republic of Korea were invited from AFC.

With all three games in Group D ending in ties and Canada tied with the Republic of Korea on every tiebreaker, a coin toss was used. Canada won and advanced to the quarter-finals. They went on to win the championship, upsetting defending champions Mexico in golden goal extra time 2-1. They defeated Trinidad and Tobago in the semi-finals 1-0 after Craig Forrest saved a first-half penalty, and, already assured as CONCACAF champions, topped invitees Colombia 2-0 in the final.[1]
