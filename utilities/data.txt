Format

In this round, four teams, as determined by the OFC in March 2014,[3] played a single round-robin tournament held in a single country which was later decided to be in Tonga.[1] All matches were held at the Loto-Tonga Soka Centre in Nuku'alofa.

Samoa, the winner, advanced to the 2016 OFC Nations Cup, held from 28 May - 12 June 2016, to join the other seven teams which received a bye into the group stage. The winner of the OFC Nations Cup, New Zealand, will represent the OFC at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup. Moreover, the OFC Nations Cup served as the second round of qualifying for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, with the top six teams advancing to the third round of FIFA World Cup qualifying.[4]
Participating teams

In April 2014 the OFC announced its executive's decision on the teams to compete in the tournament. The four lowest ranked teams (based on FIFA World Ranking and sporting reasons) among the 11 OFC entrants entered the first round:[3]

2018 FIFA World Cup qualification - OFC Third Round
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The third round of OFC matches for 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification began on 7 November 2016.[1]

Format

A total of six teams which advanced from the OFC Nations Cup (second round) were drawn into two groups of three teams to play home-and-away round-robin matches. The winners of each group will advance to the OFC Final, played home-and-away over two legs, and the winners of the final will advance to the inter-confederation play-offs.

Seeding

The draw for the third round was held on 8 July 2016, 11:00 NZST (UTC+12), at the OFC headquarters in Auckland, New Zealand.[2]

The seeding was based on the results of the 2016 OFC Nations Cup (second round):

    The OFC Nations Cup champions (New Zealand) and runners-up (Papua New Guinea) were seeded as A1 and B1 respectively.
    Pot 1 contained the OFC Nations Cup losing semi-finalists (New Caledonia and Solomon Islands).
    Pot 2 contained the third-placed teams of the OFC Nations Cup group stage (Fiji and Tahiti).

Each group contained a seeded team, a team from Pot 1, and a team from Pot 2. The same group compositions as the OFC Nations Cup were not allowed by the draw (i.e., Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia and Tahiti in one group, New Zealand, Solomon Islands and Fiji in the other group). The fixtures of each group were confirmed by the OFC after the draw, taking into account the need for New Zealand to have a bye in June 2017 for playing in the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, and Papua New Guinea to have a bye in November 2016 for hosting the 2016 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup.[2]
