The 1993 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the second edition of the Gold Cup, the football (soccer) championship of North America, Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF).[1]

The format of the tournament stayed the same as in 1991: eight teams were broken up into two groups of four, with the top two in each group advancing to the semifinals. It was the first Gold Cup to be co-hosted; Group A was held in the United States (Dallas), and Group B in Mexico (Mexico City). The tournament was won by Mexico, who beat the US 4-0 in the final.[2]
