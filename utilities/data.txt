The 1995 Copa América football tournament was staged in Uruguay. It was won by Uruguay, who beat Brazil 5-3 in the penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw in the final. All 10 CONMEBOL members took part, with Mexico and the USA invited in order to reach 12 teams.[2]

The USA were the surprise of the tournament, beating defending champions Argentina 3-0 and winning the group.[3] The USA went on to defeat Mexico on penalties in the second round but then lost to Brazil 1-0 in the semi-finals. They then fell to Colombia 4-1 in the third-place game, finishing fourth overall.[4][5]

In this edition of the tournament, extra time was never played if a match was drawn after 90 minutes. Instead it went straight to a penalty shootout.

First round

The teams were divided into three groups of four teams each.

Each team plays one match against each of the other teams within the same group. Three (3) points are awarded for a win, one (1) point for a draw and zero (0) points for a defeat.

First and second placed teams, in each group, advance to the quarter-finals. The best third placed team and the second best third placed team, also advance to the quarter-finals.

    Tie-breaker
        If teams finish leveled on points, the following tie-breakers are used:
        greater goal difference in all group games;
        greater number of goals scored in all group games;
        winner of the head-to-head match between the teams in question;
        drawing of lots.
