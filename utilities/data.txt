The 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup was the fourth FIFA Confederations Cup, and the second organised by FIFA. The tournament was hosted by Mexico between 24 July and 4 August 1999.

It was won by Mexico, who beat Brazil 4-3 in the final. Mexico became the first host nation to win the FIFA Confederations Cup. The competition was to originally be held in three stadiums, in three cities in the country. However, since the stadiums in Monterrey were sponsored by a competing beer company other than the official advertiser, the city was left out of the tournament altogether.

The tournament was organized in two groups of four teams, in which two teams from both groups advanced to the semi-finals.
