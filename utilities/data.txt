A total of 40 teams (teams ranked 1-34 in the AFC entrant list and six first round winners) were divided into eight groups of five teams to play home-and-away round-robin matches. The eight group winners and the four best group runners-up advanced to the third round of FIFA World Cup qualification as well as qualify for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup finals.

A total of 24 teams eliminated from World Cup qualification in the second round competed in the third round of 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification (which was separated from the third round of 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification), where they were divided into six groups of four teams and competed for the remaining slots of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. The 24 teams consisted of the 16 highest ranked teams eliminated in the second round, and the eight teams that advance from the play-off round of 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification which are contested by the remaining 12 teams eliminated in the second round.[2]
Seeding

The draw for the second round was held on 14 April 2015, at 17:00 MST (UTC+8), at the JW Marriott Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.[3][4]

The seeding was based on the FIFA World Rankings of April 2015 (shown in parentheses below).[5] The 40 teams were seeded into five pots:[6]

    Pot 1 contained the teams ranked 1-8.
    Pot 2 contained the teams ranked 9-16.
    Pot 3 contained the teams ranked 17-24.
    Pot 4 contained the teams ranked 25-32.
    Pot 5 contained the teams ranked 33-40.

Each group contained one team from each of the five pots. The fixtures of each group were automatically decided based on the respective pot of each team.

As the seeding order was based on the most recent FIFA Rankings prior to the draw, it differed from the order in the AFC entrant list, which was based on the FIFA World Rankings of January 2015. Among the six first round winners, three were seeded higher than pot 5 (India in pot 3, Timor-Leste and Bhutan in pot 4), on the basis of ranking points gained from the first round matches, while the other three (Yemen, Cambodia and Chinese Taipei) were seeded in pot 5.

Note: Bolded teams qualified for the third round.

Notes:

    On 16 October 2015, FIFA announced that the Kuwait Football Association (KFA) was suspended with immediate effect, following a decision from the FIFA Executive Committee that sports law of Kuwait had to be changed before 15 October.[28] The Myanmar v Kuwait match, scheduled for 17 November 2015, was not played due to that suspension,[29] and on 13 January 2016, FIFA decided that that match should be forfeited by Kuwait, and awarded as a 3-0 win for Myanmar.[30] The Kuwait v Laos and South Korea v Kuwait matches, scheduled for 24 and 29 March 2016 respectively, did not take place as scheduled, and on 6 April, FIFA decided that those matches should be forfeited by Kuwait, and awarded as 3-0 wins for Laos and South Korea.[31]

    FIFA awarded North Korea a 3-0 win as a result of Yemen fielding the ineligible player Mudir Al-Radaei, after North Korea had defeated Yemen 1-0. Al-Radaei failed to serve an automatic one match suspension for receiving two yellow cards earlier in the First Round of the competition.[38]

Ranking of runner-up teams

To determine the four best runner-up teams, the following criteria were used:

    Points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss)
    Goal difference
    Goals scored
    Play-off match(es) on neutral ground (if approved by FIFA Organizing Committee), with extra time and penalty shoot-out if necessary

As a result of Indonesia being disqualified by FIFA suspension, Group F contained only four teams compared to five teams in all other groups. Therefore, the results against the fifth-placed team were not counted when determining the ranking of the runner-up teams.[40]

Notes

Syria play their home matches outside Syria due to security concerns from the Syrian Civil War.
The kickoff of the Syria v Iran match was originally at 20:00 local time but was delayed by 45 minutes due to heavy rain.[7]
Iraq play their home matches in Iran due to security concerns from the Iraqi Civil War. However, due to Saudi Arabia's refusal to play in Iran after the attack on their diplomatic missions in Iran, the first match was played in Malaysia.[8]

    The Australia v Saudi Arabia match was brought forward from 13 June 2017 due to Australia's participation in the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.[9]
